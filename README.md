# FVanalysis
Choriocapillaris flow voids analysis bar and log-log plots featuring the number of flow voids against area size.  Log-log plot best fit line parameters (intercept, slope) and the fraction of flow voids exceeding 10,000 square micron (FV10000) over the total eye surface are provided.

Choriocapillaris flow voids analysis is described in:
